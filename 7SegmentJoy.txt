Using FreeRTOS
-> Construct a task to display a counter that counts every Â½ second from 42 to
    00 and then from 00 to 42.
    + Think of using a queue to communicate between tasks.
-> Blink the D13 LED on each count NOT USING DELAY! Write a task to do this and
    communicate this task from the counter task.
    + Semaphores or queues can work for this.

As you see in the schematics, both 7 segment LEDs are controlled by the same
D0-D7 data pins. That means to see both digits, we must multiplex the displays.
The Test program for the 7 Segment program will give you the data pins (plus it
is ALL ON THE SCHEMATIC).

-> Multiplex the 7 segment displays.
    + Build two additional tasks to do this. One to display the left digit of
    the display and one to display the right digit.
    + Alternate between tasks over 30 times a second to allow the mind to see
    two digits light up.
    - How to synchronize the tasks? Semaphore?

Write up Required
-> Two page description of your program, specifically describing tasks.
-> A block diagram showing your program architecture.
    + YOU MUST HAVE ALL YOUR TASKS ON THE BLOCK DIAGRAM WITH PRIORITY NOTED!
-> Source code.
-> Video submission of software and verbal description of your program (short).
    + MUST INCLUDE a piece of paper with the date and your name in the video!
